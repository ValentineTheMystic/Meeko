<h2 align='center'>Description</h2>

<p align='center'>This project is not yet functional<br />
This is by no means a finished product but many of
it's basic features are functional, if a bit clumsy.
For the time being this repo mainly serves the purpose
of helping me to visualize the project structure.</p><br />

<p> Meeko seeks to be an automated "set it and forget it" wifi reconasciance tool<br />
that can monitor its environtment and make intelligent decisions about how to<br />
proceed in a manner that maximizes the collection of information seen as valuable, while<br />
minimizing it's own impact in order to remain unnoticed.</p>


<h2 align='center'>Hardware</h2>
<p align="center">Most common hardware paired with a packet injection
capable wifi antennae should be compatible. Listed below are configurations
I have confirmed through testing.</p>

Device: [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)<br />
OS: [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)<br />
Wifi Adapter: [Panda Wireless Model: PAU09](http://www.pandawireless.com/pandaN600ant.htm)<br />

<h2 align='center'>To-Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create the mainloop function
  <li>Complete memory and recall features
  <li>Add hcxdump functionality
  <li>Create dynamic configuration files
</ul>
